## How to use

1. **GitHub Organization owner:** Fork template into a repository owned by a GitHub Organization (for the time being, GitHub Codespaces does not work with repositories owned by individuals)
2. **GitHub Organization owner:** Add users to the Organization, allow Codespace access
3. **Users:** Click on the repository's web page on "Code -> Codespaces -> New Codespace", a new Codespace setup takes typically less than 3 minutes (wait until pip installed all requirements)
