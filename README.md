# Quantum Computing Template For GitHub's Codespaces

Template for a ready-made QC development environment, incl. examples. The environment includes all required frameworks and libraries (Python, Qiskit, DWave Ocean, Cirq, PennyLane, ...) and can be setup in less than 3 minutes!

### How to use

1. Fork template into a repository owned by GitHub Organization (for the time being, Codespacecs does not work with repositories owned by individuals)
2. Add users to the Organization
3. Users can then click on the repository's web page on "Code -> Codespaces -> New Codespace"
4. A new Codespace setup takes typically less than 3 minutes (wait until pip installed all requirements)
5. Users can then open one of the examples and run it
