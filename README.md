## How to use

1. GitHub Organization owner: Fork template into a repository owned by a GitHub Organization (for the time being, GitHub Codespaces does not work with repositories owned by individuals)
2. GitHub Organization owner: Add users to the Organization, allow Codespace access
3. Users: Click on the repository's web page on "Code -> Codespaces -> New Codespace", a new Codespace setup takes typically less than 3 minutes (wait until pip installed all requirements)
